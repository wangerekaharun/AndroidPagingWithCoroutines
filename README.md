# AndroidPagingWithCoroutines

## Update Note

This project uses a version of the Paging Library which is below v3.0. Paging 3.0 is a complete re-write of the library. It uses Kotlin, and it has first-class support for Kotlin coroutines and flow. It also has some new features. For example, it supports headers and footers, and it has retry and refresh mechanisms. Luckily, I have a tutorial on [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/) on the same. You can have a read here: [Paging Library for Android With Kotlin: Creating Infinite Lists.](https://www.raywenderlich.com/12244218-paging-library-for-android-with-kotlin-creating-infinite-lists) 

The master branch has implementation of Paging With Coroutines using a version of the paging library which is below v3.0. I have added a new branch, [paging-3.0](https://github.com/wangerekaharun/AndroidPagingWithCoroutines/tree/paging-3.0) with all the additions from Paging 3.0


The detailed explanation for the implementation on the master branch can be found in the [Android Paging Library with Kotlin Coroutines](https://medium.com/@harunwangereka/android-paging-library-with-kotlin-coroutines-b96602e3fae3) article
